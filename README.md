# Your Guide to Understanding Earthquakes
Published on October 6, 2025

Welcome to Earthquake Today, your essential resource for real-time seismic information. In a world where the ground beneath our feet is constantly shifting, being informed is the first step toward safety and understanding. This guide will walk you through the features of our platform, explain the science behind earthquakes, and provide practical safety tips.

# Introducing Earthquake Today: Your Go-To Earthquake Tracker
Our mission is to make seismic data accessible and easy to understand. Whether you're checking on an earthquake today or exploring historical trends, our powerful earthquake tracker has the tools you need.

# Key Features of Our Platform
Real-Time Global Data: We provide up-to-the-minute information on the latest earthquake events from around the globe, sourced from trusted agencies like the USGS.
Interactive Map: Visualize every tremor on a dynamic global map. Switch between satellite and street views to get the full picture.
Powerful Filtering: Sort and filter the data by magnitude or time to find exactly what you're looking for.
"Near Me" Mode: With a single click, see all recent seismic activity in your immediate vicinity.
Detailed Event Pages: Click on any event to get an in-depth look, including tectonic context and historical data for that specific area.

# Understanding Magnitude Scales
When you see a number associated with an earthquake, that's its magnitude. But what does it mean? The most commonly used scale is the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS), which has replaced the Richter scale for large quakes. It's a logarithmic scale, which means for each whole number you go up, the ground shaking increases by 10 times and the energy released increases by about 32 times.

M 2.5 or less: Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismographs. Millions occur every year.
M 2.5 to 5.4: Often felt, but only causes minor damage.
M 5.5 to 6.0: Can cause slight damage to buildings and other structures.
M 6.1 to 6.9: May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.
M 7.0 or greater: Major earthquake. Can cause serious damage over larger areas.
M 8.0 or greater: Great earthquake. Can cause widespread, catastrophic damage.

# What Are Tectonic Plates?
The Earth's outer shell is made up of large, moving pieces called tectonic plates. Earthquakes occur when these plates grind past, crash into, or pull apart from each other. The edges of these plates are called plate boundaries, and they are where the vast majority of the world's earthquakes happen. Our detail pages use AI to provide context on the specific tectonic plates involved in an earthquake, giving you a deeper understanding of why it occurred.

# Crucial Earthquake Safety Tips
Knowing what to do during an earthquake can save your life. The golden rule is Drop, Cover, and Hold On.

# If You Are Indoors:
DROP to your hands and knees.
COVER your head and neck with your arms. If possible, crawl under a sturdy desk or table for shelter.
HOLD ON to your shelter until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with it.

# If You Are Outdoors:
Move to a clear area away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and power lines.
Drop to the ground and stay there until the shaking stops.
After the Shaking Stops:
Check yourself for injuries, then help others if you can.
Be prepared for aftershocks.
If you are in a damaged building, get out as soon as it is safe.
Listen to emergency officials for instructions.
